This means it will be more active (turn on genes) when cholesterol is high.\n\n2. **Protein Production:**  The promoter controls the production of a protein that lowers cholesterol.  \n\n3. **Control:** The system acts like a thermostat for cholesterol. When cholesterol is high, the promoter activates, leading to increased production of the cholesterol-lowering protein. When cholesterol is low, the promoter is less active, and less of the protein is produced.\n\n**Our Progress This Semester:**\n\n* **Promoter Validation:** We confirmed that our synthetic promoter responds differently to high and low cholesterol levels using a dual luciferase assay. This assay measures the activity of our promoter and showed that it's most active (and would produce the most cholesterol-lowering protein) in high cholesterol conditions.\n* **Cell Culture Optimization:** We optimized the conditions for growing human cells and introducing our engineered system. This includes finding the right amount of DNA and transfection reagent to ensure the system is efficiently delivered into the cells.\n\n**Future Steps:**\n\n* **Inverter Sequence:** We'll test a special \"inverter\" sequence to ensure our system functions as intended (turning on the cholesterol-lowering protein when cholesterol is high).\n\n* **Pristinamycin-Induced Protein:** We'll study the physical properties of a protein induced by pristinamycin, a molecule we plan to use to control our system.\n* **System Testing:** We'll test our complete system in cells under different cholesterol conditions to confirm it effectively regulates cholesterol levels.\n\n**Overall, our project has the potential to:**\n\n* **Develop a novel therapeutic approach** for managing cholesterol levels.\n* **Advance our understanding of synthetic biology** and gene regulation.\n\n\n\nWe believe this project has the potential to win the Gold level iGEM award, the village prize for therapeutics, and the grand prize. \n"}

This means the promoter's activity (and thus the expression of a gene it controls) increases when cholesterol levels are high.\n\n2. **Dual Luciferase Assay:** To confirm this, we used a Dual Luciferase Assay (DLA). This assay compares the luminescence of two proteins, Renilla and Firefly, produced by our system.  The ratio of these luminescences reflects the activity of our cholesterol-sensitive promoter. \n\n3. **High and Low Cholesterol Conditions:** We established specific cholesterol levels in cell culture to simulate high and low cholesterol environments.  We carefully optimized transfection procedures to ensure efficient delivery of our genetic material into the cells.\n\n4. **Results:** Our DLA results clearly show that the promoter's activity indeed changes based on the cholesterol concentration.  \n\n**Future Steps:**\n\n* **Inverter Sequence:** We'll introduce an \"inverter\" sequence to reverse the promoter's response, so it actively lowers cholesterol when levels are high.\n* **Pristinamycin-Induced Protein:** We'll investigate a pristinamycin-inducible protein and its physical properties (binding affinity, degradation rate) to control the system's activation.\n* **Final Plasmid Testing:**  We'll create the complete plasmid containing the inverter and pristinamycin-inducible elements, and test it under controlled cholesterol conditions to validate its performance.\n\n**Winning Potential:**\n\nThis project addresses a significant health challenge (cholesterol regulation).

We want to create a tool to help manage cholesterol levels.\n\n* **Our Approach:** We're using synthetic biology to engineer a system that responds to changes in cholesterol concentration.  \n\n* **Key Components:**\n\n    * **Sensitive Promoter:** We've identified a promoter (a DNA sequence that controls gene expression) that becomes more active when cholesterol levels are high.\n    * **Luciferase Reporter:** We're using luciferase, an enzyme that produces light, as a reporter. This allows us to easily measure the activity of our promoter in different cholesterol conditions.\n    * **Therapeutic Target:** Our goal is to eventually use this system to control the expression of a gene that affects cholesterol production.\n\n* **This Semester's Progress:**\n\n    * **Promoter Validation:** We confirmed that our promoter is indeed sensitive to cholesterol levels. We used a dual luciferase assay to measure the activity of the promoter under different cholesterol conditions. \n    * **Assay Optimization:** We optimized the transfection procedure (getting our DNA into cells) and the dual luciferase assay itself to ensure accurate and reproducible results. \n\n* **Future Directions:**\n\n    * **Inverter Sequence:** We'll test an \"inverter\" sequence to reverse the response of our system, so it becomes active at low cholesterol levels.\n    * **Therapeutic Gene:** We'll identify and test a gene that can be used to regulate cholesterol production.\n    * **Vector Construction:** We'll assemble all the components into a final plasmid (a circular piece of DNA) that can be used to deliver our system into cells.\n    * **In Vivo Testing:** We'll test the performance of our system in animal models to see if it can effectively regulate cholesterol levels.\n\n**Why This is a Gold Medal-Winning Project:**\n\n* **Novelty:** Our project tackles a significant health problem using a cutting-edge approach.\n* **Rigor:** We have used rigorous experimental techniques to validate our key components.\n* **Impact:**  If successful, our project has the potential to lead to new therapies for high cholesterol.\n* **Teamwork:**  We have a strong team with diverse skills who are working collaboratively to achieve our goals.\n\n**Winning the Village Prize and Grand Prize:**\n\n* **Therapeutic Focus:**  Our project directly addresses a major health challenge, making it eligible for the Village Prize for Therapeutics.\n* **Overall Excellence:**  We are confident that our project's innovation, rigor, and potential impact will make us strong contenders for the Grand Prize.\n\n\n\n"}
