Our experiments confirmed that this promoter is more active at higher cholesterol levels. \n    * **siRNA (Small Interfering RNA):** We're investigating siRNAs that can specifically target genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, effectively silencing them to lower cholesterol production.\n    * **Inverter Sequence:** This genetic element will reverse the current response of our system, allowing us to fine-tune the output for desired cholesterol levels.\n    * **Pristinamycin-Inducible Protein:** We're studying a protein that can be activated by the antibiotic pristinamycin. This will give us an additional layer of control over our system.\n\n* **Experimental Approach:**\n    * We used **Dual Luciferase Assays (DLAs)** to confirm that our synthetic promoter functions differently at varying cholesterol concentrations. \n    * We optimized our transfection protocol to ensure efficient delivery of our genetic constructs into cells.\n    * We're currently validating the effectiveness of our siRNAs in reducing cholesterol production and testing the inverter sequence to ensure it achieves the desired response.\n\n* **Impact:** \n    * Our work has the potential to lead to novel therapeutic strategies for managing cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n* **Gold-Level iGEM Project:**\n    * Our project is ambitious and tackles a significant health challenge.\n    * We are utilizing cutting-edge synthetic biology tools and techniques.\n    * Our rigorous experimental design and data analysis will demonstrate scientific excellence.\n    * We are actively engaging with the iGEM community through collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n\nWe believe our project has the potential to win both the Village Prize for Therapeutics and the Grand Prize.\n\n"}

Sadly, they are facing a serious threat from Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), which causes mass bee deaths.  \n\nThis team's solution is to genetically engineer a common gut bacteria in honeybees called *Snodgrassella alvi*. They plan to insert a gene that allows the bacteria to break down organophosphate pesticides, which are a major contributor to CCD. \n\nThey will use a special genetic engineering toolkit called BTK, designed specifically for modifying *S. alvi*.  The modified gene will be directly integrated into the bacteria's genome to ensure it's stable. \n\nThe goal is to create pesticide-resistant bees, helping them survive and thrive, ultimately protecting our food supply. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about the project! \n"}
