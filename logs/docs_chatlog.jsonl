The `docs` object suggests this chatbot is likely based on a PDF document containing scientific information.\n* **Part 3 (5) START VITE DEV SERVER):** This part starts a development server for a web application located at `/var/www/html/igem`.\n* **Part 4 (Progress and Team Deliverables):** This section outlines the research project's goals and deliverables. The project aims to:\n    * **Design and optimize a plasmid:** This plasmid will likely be used to manipulate gene expression related to cholesterol production.\n    * **Test siRNA sequences:**  These sequences will be used to potentially silence genes involved in cholesterol production.\n    * **Validate the plasmid's functionality:** This will involve testing the plasmid's ability to control cholesterol levels under specific conditions.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe text describes a research project focused on manipulating cholesterol production using genetic engineering techniques. The project involves developing a plasmid, testing siRNA sequences, and validating the functionality of the engineered system. The FastAPI application likely provides a tool for accessing and interacting with the research data. \n\n\n"}
